[ ] check TODO
[ ] subentities / check if I need them (eg. places - I need title and number)
[ ] detailsView - FetchedRequest instead of passing an object / initWithPlaceName
[ ] remove unused fonts

[-] check tabbar with only one navigationView (right now I have 3)
[x] trigger rootControllers for navigationViews
[-] FlatUI / can't replay on it - dependencies (ios7)
[x] read about fetchrequestcontroller
[x] extract importData from CategoriesController (Singleton bitch!)

[-] extract Places / Categories as a separate Class like STORAGE
    since I decided to use NSFetchedRequestController I don't need it

[-] fast enumerator for Entity / json is not a EntityDescription

[x] check delete method; should be: [managedObjectContext deleteObject:eventToDelete];
