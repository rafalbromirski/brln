[ ] check TODO
[ ] check reusedIdentifier
[ ] add rating (https://github.com/arashpayan/appirater/)

[x] subentities / check if I need them (eg. places - I need title and number)
[x] remove unused fonts
[x] check icon-list tabbar (1px diff?)
[x] trigger rootControllers for navigationViews
[x] read about fetchrequestcontroller
[x] extract importData from CategoriesController (Singleton bitch!)
[x] check delete method; should be: [managedObjectContext deleteObject:eventToDelete];

[-] check tabbar with only one navigationView (right now I have 3)
[-] FlatUI / can't replay on it - dependencies (ios7)
[-] extract Places / Categories as a separate Class like STORAGE
    since I decided to use NSFetchedRequestController I don't need it
[-] fast enumerator for Entity / json is not a EntityDescription
[-] detailsView - FetchedRequest instead of passing an object / initWithPlaceName
